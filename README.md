Intro to Hadoop

- High Level Description of Hadoop Ecosystem
  - Created by Doug Cutting
  - Named for his son's toy elephant
  - Scalable, batch processing with reliable, redundant storage.
  - Built on two fundamental components
    - HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)
      - Based on concepts from Googleâ€™s GFS paper:
        - <a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/archive/gfs-sosp2003.pdf">The Google File System</a>
    - MapReduce framework
      - Based on 2004 paper from Google on MapReduce:
        - <a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf">MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters</a>
      - Java-based (starting with v1)
      - Streaming, allows non-Java coding (starting with MRv2/YARN)
- Examples of previous work and planned work
  - Baseball streaming
    - Listener stats
  - Handyman service
    - Error log analysis
    - Job and Craftsman skills match
    - Potential for marketing/zip code analysis
  - Ceiling fan manufacturer (future plans)
    - Failure analysis
    - Sentiment analysis of AS/400 text-based call logs from customer call-in
- Hadoop distributions
  - Cloudera
  - Hortonworks
  - HDInsight
  - Amazon Elastic MapReduce

Discussion

- HDFS
  - Default of 3 copies of data
  - Contains large block size to handle large numbers of files
  - Deep storage
  - Schema-on-read
- MapReduce
  - Java/JVM based paradigm
  - MRv2/YARN - Streaming, can use ruby, other languages
  - This structure brings the code to the data

MapReduce Example

- Review WeatherData Java code
- Run WeatherData example
  - Point out Map/Reduce percentage as job runs
- Discuss WeatherData example
- Q & A about WeatherData exampe

Overview of Hive and Pig

- Hive
  - High-level query atop MapReduce
  - Similar to SQL
  - HiveQL compatible with many SQL flavors
  - Compiles queries to MapReduce
  - Can see MapReduce progress on longer queries
  - Run Hive examples

- Pig
  - High-level "scripting" atop MapReduce
  - Run Pig examples
  - Can see MapReduce progress on longer queries
